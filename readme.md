## Reflection
Working as a QA Analyst is a very significant role in the software development process. In the process, I learned that each function of an application is very intricate and needs to undergo thorough testing before and after being pushed into a production environment. Sufficient edge cases should be tested to confirm the functions of something as simple as user authentication is robust. The environment in which these functions are tested is also importatnt. Although it is important to do testing locally, it is even more important to test in the cloud. In reality, applications are imaged, packaged, and live in a container in the cloud. <br/>
Working in a collaborative environment is also paramount in the development process. Being able to identify issues within a codebase and raise concern amongst collaborators is important for a myriad of reasons. This functiionality can reveal oversights, vulnerabilities, and other general errors to all that should be notified. Fixing these issues and documenting them properly can help promote not only awareness, but growth within a devleopment team. If all are aware, similar issues are likely to either not occur agian or be relatively quicker fixes in the future.
